"Applied computer science in economics"


I've been around computers since my childhood. My father, who was a geophysicist have been bringing me to his work: I was sitting there among computers playing Prince of Percia, drinking a hot tea and eating a cake. Best time in my life.

In 2001, when I was 12, my parents bought a computer. At that time at school we were taught BASIC - it was fun but not that much applicable to real life. Surfing the Internet, I found a book teaching HTML and CSS and built my first website. 

Then I got interested in programming and started to learn C++ using a textbook by Paulo Franca. Afterward, I've spent some time playing around with other programming languages, messing around the command line, and learning about computer hardware by disassembling and rebuilding my PC. Parallel to this, I finished school and then [Murmansk State Technical University](http://www.mstu.edu.ru/).

During my first year at university, I started building websites for small businesses. Soon enough, I got an internship as a web designer at the local agency [Arctic Media Group](http://arcticmedia.ru/). After this, I started to work with various web studios and individuals as a freelancer/independent contractor. I've been doing mostly frontend and CMS-integration stuff.

In 2014, due to the accumulated fatigue, I made a decision to quit web development and try myself in a field unrelated to IT.

In 2018 I returned to programming but decided I want to transition into backend development. Since then, I started "rebooting" myself professionally, learning new things every day, and still do this.
