**Hi, my name is Andrey. I'm a programmer specializing in Node.js.**

I've been doing web development since the mid 2000s; over the years, I have gradually transitioned from web design to frontend development and then (since 2018) to backend development. Self-taught. For most of my career, I have been working alone, as a contractor.

My current stack (since 2018):

* **Languages:** JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js), SQL, Bash
* **Databases:** PostgreSQL, Redis
* **Infrastructure**: Linux, Nginx, Docker
* **Protocols:** HTTP, WebSocket
* **Frameworks:** Express.js, React.js; Jest for testing
